# Altair Visualization for Underdogs Devs
This repository is incomplete. I am in the middle of developing visualizations using Altair, as 

Machine Learning Engineer, for [UnderdogDevs.org](https://www.underdogdevs.org) a non-profit organization.<br/><br/>

### Here is a little about Underdog Devs:

They are a group of software engineers helping aspiring developers who are either from an

economically disadvantaged background or formerly incarcerated. They are creating opportunities 

in tech for people who might not otherwise get an opportunity. They were founded in September of 2020

They currently depend on 100% volunteer support.

### Unemployment and Poverty

Employment has long been recognized as having a negative correlation with crime (Uggen, 1999; 

Uggen et al., 2005).<br/>
Researchers also have found that employment is associated with reduced recidivism(Skardhamar & Telle, 2012).<br/>

The strongest predictor for recidivism: poverty + unemployment.
### Recidivism
According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 67.8% of released state prisoners were arrested for a new crime within three years, and 76.7% were arrested within five years (Durose, Cooper, & Snyder, 2014). Reducing recidivism not only protects society at large, but also improves the life quality of individual ex-prisoners.<br/>
Incarceration rates in the U.S. began increasing dramatically in the 1990s. The U.S. has the highest prison population of any country, comprising 25% of the worldâ€™s prisoners.
