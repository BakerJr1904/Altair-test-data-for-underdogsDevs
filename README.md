# Altair test data for underdogs Devs
This repository is incomplete. I am in the middle of developing visualizations using Altair, as Machine Learning Engineer, for UnderdogDevs.org a non-profit organization.<br/><br/>
### Here is a little about Underdog Devs:
They are a group of software engineers helping aspiring developers who are either formerly incarcerated or from an economically disadvantaged background. They are creating opportunities in tech for people who might not otherwise get an opportunity. They were founded in September of 2020
We currently depend on 100% volunteer support
